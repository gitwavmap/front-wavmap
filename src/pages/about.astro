            <p class="large">Our vision</p>
            <p class="text-base">With WAVMAP, we want to contribute to an electronic music
              scene where every person feels equally welcome and has the possibility to express
              themselves, be creative and enjoy the pleasures of club culture. This means
              confronting the oppressive systems ingrained in our societies - such as but
              not limited to racism, sexism, antisemitism, homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia,
              ableism and classism - that shape who gets access to spaces, resources, and
              recognition under capitalism. While we've all been socialized under these
              systems, their violence disproportionately targets marginalized communities.</p>

            <p class="text-base">
              Dance music and club culture have emerged as an attempt to create
              safer spaces for people suffering from the above mentioned systems
              of oppression. This is especially true for racialised and queer people.
              We recognize that while no space is ever entirely free of existent power
              dynamics, we aim to foster safer environments that actively challenge
              gendered, racial, and sexual hierarchies. This includes centering the
              voices of racialised people, women, trans, and non-binary people, and
              addressing barriers of accessibility and participation. Our goal is to
              cultivate solidarity and respect, online and offline, through ongoing
              reflection and collective responsibility.
            </p>

            <p class="text-base">In addition to the above, we also believe in transborder
              solidarity. In times of war, occupation, and displacement (from Europe to the
              SWANA region and beyond), we hope WAVMAP can foster a community that
              transcends borders, celebrating what unites us over what divides us.
              Therefore, we want to give importance to voices from affected regions
              and support initiatives that align with our values.</p>

            <p class="text-base">
              All users of WAVMAP and participants of WAVMAP events of any kind shall
              accept the following code of conduct and contribute, according to their
              personal situation and capabilities, to a joyful and liberating electronic
              music scene for all. We acknowledge that we all still have to learn, but
              we believe in the transformative power of collective action and music.

            <p class="text-base">
              We live in a society in which unequal power relations are a reality. People
              have privileges or face discrimination on the basis of different characteristics.
               Discrimination can happen intentionally, but in most cases it happens unintentionally.
               Awareness is a concept that opposes all forms of discrimination, violence and boundary
              violations. We want to empower those affected and actively support in developing their own
              strategies for dealing with discrimination.

            <p class="text-base">
              Whether it is during in-person or online events linked to WAVMAP, we have a
              responsibility towards each other to ensure that everyone has the best experience.
              We encourage all users and participants to treat everyone with respect, dignity and
              kindness. We don't tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment and abuse - whether
              verbal or physical. We want an atmosphere in which everyone is able to speak up and in
              which different levels of knowledge can be brought together productively. An approachable
              and attentive culture of discussion is a crucial basis for this. We advocate openness to
              a wide range of positions and tolerance for ambivalence, as well as the need for dialog
              - as long as this does not involve discrimination or crossing boundaries and is done in a respectful way.

              We want to encourage WAVMAP users and participants in our events and other
              activities to be aware of their position within a group and underlying power
              structures. Don't take too much space and give enough space to others, especially
              people from marginalised groups. This applies to physical space as well as space
              within a conversation. For example: Reflect on how your identity (e.g., gender,
              race, ability) might affect how much space you take in conversations or decision-making.
              We can only confront, change and dismantle power structures by working together. For us,
              this includes raising awareness of our own privileges and existing power structures, as
              well as the initiative, self-reflection and sensitization of each individual.

              Consent
            </p>
            <p class="text-base">
              We want to create an environment where all interactions, especially physical
              ones or discussions of sensitive topics, are grounded in consent. Consent must
              always be explicit, enthusiastic, reversible, and ongoing: whether for physical
              touch (e.g., dancing), photography, or personal conversations. Only yes means
              yes, and a yes can always be withdrawn.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base">
              At the same time, we recognize that consent does not exist in a vacuum: power
              dynamics linked to gender, race and status can influence how consent is expressed
              and respected. This is why we see consent as a collective responsibility: not only
              about asking and listening, but also about looking out for one another, intervening
              if boundaries are crossed, and fostering a culture of care where marginalized people
              feel safe to set their limits.

              Respecting each one's personal boundaries is fundamental to
              creating an environment where everyone feels respected. Whenever
              someone requests to respect their personal boundaries, it is
              important to do so. Please refrain from questioning other
              people's perceptions when it comes to their personal boundaries.
              Just because you perceive something differently, as less bad or
              not bad at all, it doesn't have to correspond to the perception
              and feelings of the other person.

              We want to encourage the use of inclusive language that doesn't
              make assumptions about others. The use of pronouns according to a
              person's wish creates an environment where they feel welcomed.
              If you are unsure which pronouns a person uses, do not simply
              assume a gender based on appearance, but ask about the pronouns
              or do not use any pronouns until you have learned them (e.g. only
              use the name of the person). Also, please do not use derogatory or
              discriminatory terms in any form.

              of an incident, the person negatively affected by discrimination and/or
              the violation of their personal boundaries always decides what support
              is required. Together with our team, options for dealing with the
              incident are discussed and actions will be taken accordingly.
              Where possible, we provide a safe and quiet room to provide a place
              of retreat for affected persons. Posters will be displayed at the
              event explaining how to contact the relevant staff and will include
              contact details. Additionally you can report problematic situations after the event by writing to us at <a href="mailto:help@wavmap.org">help@wavmap.org</a>. Reporting is

                For marginalized artists, knowing the political values of collaborators

                co-founding by the European Union via the <a href="https://www.livemx.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiveMX</a> program. LiveMX aims at

                Creative Europe program, so the initial list only includes countries

            <p class="large">Our vision</p>
            <p class="text-base">With WAVMAP, we want to contribute to an electronic music
              scene where every person feels equally welcome and has the possibility to express
              themselves, be creative and enjoy the pleasures of club culture. This means
              confronting the oppressive systems ingrained in our societies - such as but
              not limited to racism, sexism, antisemitism, homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia,
              ableism and classism - that shape who gets access to spaces, resources, and
              recognition under capitalism. While we've all been socialized under these
              systems, their violence disproportionately targets marginalized communities.</p>

            <p class="text-base">
              Dance music and club culture have emerged as an attempt to create
              safer spaces for people suffering from the above mentioned systems
              of oppression. This is especially true for racialised and queer people.
              We recognize that while no space is ever entirely free of existent power
              dynamics, we aim to foster safer environments that actively challenge
              gendered, racial, and sexual hierarchies. This includes centering the
              voices of racialised people, women, trans, and non-binary people, and
              addressing barriers of accessibility and participation. Our goal is to
              cultivate solidarity and respect, online and offline, through ongoing
              reflection and collective responsibility.
            </p>

            <p class="text-base">In addition to the above, we also believe in transborder
              solidarity. In times of war, occupation, and displacement (from Europe to the
              SWANA region and beyond), we hope WAVMAP can foster a community that
              transcends borders, celebrating what unites us over what divides us.
              Therefore, we want to give importance to voices from affected regions
              and support initiatives that align with our values.</p>

              music scene for all. We acknowledge that we all still have to learn, but
              we believe in the transformative power of collective action and music.

            <p class="large">Why we need Awareness</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              We live in a society in which unequal power relations are a reality. People
              have privileges or face discrimination on the basis of different characteristics.
              Discrimination can happen intentionally, but in most cases it happens unintentionally.
              Awareness is a concept that opposes all forms of discrimination, violence and boundary
              violations. We want to empower those affected and actively support in developing their own
              strategies for dealing with discrimination.
            </p>

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Respect and dignity</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              Whether it is during in-person or online events linked to WAVMAP, we have a
              responsibility towards each other to ensure that everyone has the best experience.
              We encourage all users and participants to treat everyone with respect, dignity and
              kindness. We don't tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment and abuse - whether
              verbal or physical. We want an atmosphere in which everyone is able to speak up and in
              which different levels of knowledge can be brought together productively. An approachable
              and attentive culture of discussion is a crucial basis for this. We advocate openness to
              a wide range of positions and tolerance for ambivalence, as well as the need for dialog
              - as long as this does not involve discrimination or crossing boundaries and is done in a respectful way.
            </p>

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Awareness of power structures</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              We want to encourage WAVMAP users and participants in our events and other
              activities to be aware of their position within a group and underlying power
              structures. Don't take too much space and give enough space to others, especially
              people from marginalised groups. This applies to physical space as well as space
              within a conversation. For example: Reflect on how your identity (e.g., gender,
              race, ability) might affect how much space you take in conversations or decision-making.
              We can only confront, change and dismantle power structures by working together. For us,
              this includes raising awareness of our own privileges and existing power structures, as
              well as the initiative, self-reflection and sensitization of each individual.
            </p>

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Consent</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              We want to create an environment where all interactions, especially physical
              ones or discussions of sensitive topics, are grounded in consent. Consent must
              always be explicit, enthusiastic, reversible, and ongoing: whether for physical
              touch (e.g., dancing), photography, or personal conversations. Only yes means
              yes, and a yes can always be withdrawn.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base">
              At the same time, we recognize that consent does not exist in a vacuum: power
              dynamics linked to gender, race and status can influence how consent is expressed
              and respected. This is why we see consent as a collective responsibility: not only
              about asking and listening, but also about looking out for one another, intervening
              if boundaries are crossed, and fostering a culture of care where marginalized people
              feel safe to set their limits.
            </p>

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Personal boundaries</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              Respecting each one's personal boundaries is fundamental to
              creating an environment where everyone feels respected. Whenever
              someone requests to respect their personal boundaries, it is
              important to do so. Please refrain from questioning other
              people's perceptions when it comes to their personal boundaries.
              Just because you perceive something differently, as less bad or
              not bad at all, it doesn't have to correspond to the perception
              and feelings of the other person.
            </p>

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Inclusive language</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              We want to encourage the use of inclusive language that doesn't
              make assumptions about others. The use of pronouns according to a
              person's wish creates an environment where they feel welcomed.
              If you are unsure which pronouns a person uses, do not simply
              assume a gender based on appearance, but ask about the pronouns
              or do not use any pronouns until you have learned them (e.g. only
              use the name of the person). Also, please do not use derogatory or
              discriminatory terms in any form.
            </p>

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Accessibility</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              We prioritize accessibility at events (e.g. ramps, quiet spaces).
              We try to make each event as accessible for everyone to the best of
              our ability and the individual needs of our participants.
              Unfortunately at the time we can't fully guarantee sufficient accessibility at every single one of our events, but we are committed to learning over time and are constantly reviewing and improving our events in this respect. Please don't hesitate to contact us in advance for needs at <a href="mailto:help@wavmap.org">help@wavmap.org</a>.

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Reporting procedures</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              Whether it is during online or in-person events, please reach out
              to our team or any designated staff if you feel uncomfortable with
              a situation. In online-events please feel free to reach out to our
              team and/or moderator of the event via direct message. In the event
              of an incident, the person negatively affected by discrimination and/or
              the violation of their personal boundaries always decides what support
              is required. Together with our team, options for dealing with the
              incident are discussed and actions will be taken accordingly.
              Where possible, we provide a safe and quiet room to provide a place
              of retreat for affected persons. Posters will be displayed at the
              event explaining how to contact the relevant staff and will include
              contact details. Additionally you can report problematic situations after the event by writing to us at <a href="mailto:help@wavmap.org">help@wavmap.org</a>. Reporting is
              confidential. We commit to responding within 48 hours and involving
              affected parties in decisions where possible. Our team will also be
              available after an incident to provide emotional support to affected
              people and will refer them to further support services, where needed.

            <p class="large">Consequences</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              In case of abuse, harassment, violence or discrimination against
              another person or group that occurs during an online or in-person
              event, depending on the gravity of the situation and in accordance
              with victim's demands, we will take consequences ranging from
              warnings to temporary or definite exclusion from an event, as well
              as from the WAVMAP platform. Incidents might be documented
              (anonymously) and used for prevention at future events.

            <p class="large">Prioritization of safety of marginalised groups</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              Although we aim towards a club culture where everyone feels
              equally welcome, we acknowledge that this is not yet the case.
              We therefore want to collectively prioritize the safety of marginalised groups.
            </p>

            <div class="separator" />

            <p class="large">Active intervention</p>
            <p class="text-base">
              We as WAVMAP would like to openly address discrimination and the overstepping
              of personal boundaries and resolutely counter such behavior. There
              are people responsible for awareness during our events - but it
              is also necessary that we all take responsibility individually.
              As we believe in collective action and responsibility, we strongly
              encourage bystander intervention. If it is safe to do so, we
              encourage participants to intervene in a situation that appears
              to be one of harassment or discrimination. If you are unable to
              intervene for whatever reason, we encourage you to reach out to
              our team in these instances, also if you aren't affected yourself
              or if you are unsure, if a person is indeed in need of help or not.
              We call on everyone to be mindful and attentive when working
              together and ask everyone to pay attention to and respect their
              own and others' needs and boundaries. If support is required in
              communicating boundaries, our designated staff is also available for this.

                  Electronic music and rave culture have always been tied to resistance—born
                  from the creativity and need for liberation of marginalized communities
                  (BiPOC, queer, and working-class artists) who pioneered genres like techno,
                  house, footwork, and jungle. Yet today, many of these same groups face
                  exclusion as cultural appropriation, corporate interests and, in some cases,
                  fascist or reactionary ideologies infiltrate the scene.

                <p class="text-base">
                  For marginalized artists, knowing the political values of collaborators
                  and venues isn't just practical—it's a matter of safety and survival.
                  WAVMAP highlights these stances to help foster safer spaces and solidarity,
                  ensuring the scene remains a place where its creators can thrive.

                  This isn't about sacrificing joy for politics; it's about recognizing
                  that activism and celebration go hand in hand. The dance floor has always
                  been political—we're just honoring that legacy.

                  WAVMAP is a project run by Commune de nuit, a non-profit based in Marseille
                  (France). The initial platform development has been made possible thanks to a
                  co-founding by the European Union via the <a href="https://www.livemx.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiveMX</a> program. LiveMX aims at
                  supporting music export and artists mobility within Europe.

                <p class="text-base">
                  Unlike platforms backed by investment funds or corporations,
                  WAVMAP is and always will be independent and non-profit driven.

                <p class="text-base">
                  For now, everything on WAVMAP is free to use. In order to guarantee our
                  independence and ensure long-term sustainability, we may introduce optional
                  paid features in the future - fair and accessible to everyone. If you have

                  WAVMAP was made possible through co-funding of the European Union's
                  Creative Europe program, so the initial list only includes countries
                  participating in this program. This also allows us to adopt a more effective
                  and high-quality communication and distribution strategy, since we can focus
                  on a precise number of countries and their respective local scenes. However,
                  in the future, we would like to add more countries to the list. If you would
                  like to support this effort or have ideas for funding opportunities in your
                  country or region, we'd love to hear your ideas !
