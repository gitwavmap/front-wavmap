        <p class="xtra-large">CODE OF CONDUCT</p>
        <p class="large">Our Vision</p>
        <p class="text-base">With WAVMAP, we want to contribute to an electronic music 
          scene where every person feels equally welcome and has the possibility to express 
          themselves, be creative and enjoy the pleasures of club culture. This means 
          confronting the oppressive systems ingrained in our societies - such as but 
          not limited to racism, sexism, antisemitism, homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, 
          ableism and classism - that shape who gets access to spaces, resources, and 
          recognition under capitalism. While we’ve all been socialized under these 
          systems, their violence disproportionately targets marginalized communities</p>

        <p class="text-base">In addition to the above, we also believe in transborder 
          solidarity. In times of war, occupation, and displacement (from Europe to the 
          SWANA region and beyond), we hope WAVMAP can foster a community that 
          transcends borders, celebrating what unites us over what divides us. 
          Therefore, we want to give importance to voices from affected regions 
          and support initiatives that align with our values.</p>

        <p class="text-base">
          Dance music and club culture have emerged as an attempt to create 
          safer spaces for people suffering from the above mentioned systems 
          of oppression. This is especially true for racialised and queer people. 
          Although we don’t think that the electronic music scene alone will put 
          an end to these oppressions, we believe that we have a responsibility 
          in trying to create spaces where marginalized people feel included. 
          We therefore wish to create an environment of solidarity and respect, 
          both on our platform and during our online and in-person events. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          All users of WAVMAP and participants of WAVMAP events of any kind shall 
          accept the following code of conduct and contribute, according to their 
          personal situation and capabilities, to a joyful and liberating electronic 
          music scene for all. We acknowledge that we all still have to learn, but 
          we believe in the transformative power of collective action and music.

        <p class="xtra-large">
          Code of conduct
        </p>
        <p class="large">Why we need Awareness</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          We live in a society in which unequal power relations are a reality. People 
          have privileges or face discrimination on the basis of different characteristics.
           Discrimination can happen intentionally, but in most cases it happens unintentionally. 
           Awareness is a concept that opposes all forms of discrimination, violence and boundary 
          violations. We want to empower those affected and actively support in developing their own 
          strategies for dealing with discrimination.
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">
          Respect and dignity 
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          Whether it is during in-person or online events linked to WAVMAP, we have a 
          responsibility towards each other to ensure that everyone has the best experience. 
          We encourage all users and participants to treat everyone with respect, dignity and 
          kindness. We don’t tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment and abuse - whether 
          verbal or physical. We want an atmosphere in which everyone is able to speak up and in 
          which different levels of knowledge can be brought together productively. An approachable 
          and attentive culture of discussion is a crucial basis for this. We advocate openness to 
          a wide range of positions and tolerance for ambivalence, as well as the need for dialog 
          - as long as this does not involve discrimination or crossing boundaries and is done in a respectful way.
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">Awareness of power structures</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          We want to encourage WAVMAP users and participants in our events and other 
          activities to be aware of their position within a group and underlying power 
          structures. Don’t take too much space and give enough space to others, especially 
          people from marginalised groups. This applies to physical space as well as space 
          within a conversation. For example: Reflect on how your identity (e.g., gender, 
          race, ability) might affect how much space you take in conversations or decision-making. 
          We can only confront, change and dismantle power structures by working together. For us, 
          this includes raising awareness of our own privileges and existing power structures, as 
          well as the initiative, self-reflection and sensitization of each individual.
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">
          Consent
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          We want to create an environment where interactions between individuals, and 
          especially physical interactions or the discussion of sensitive topics, are 
          based on consent. Consent must be explicit, reversible, and ongoing—for 
          physical touch (e.g., dancing), photography, or personal discussions. 
          Don't forget : only yes means yes, and a yes can always be revoked ! 
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">
          Personal boundaries
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          Respecting each one’s personal boundaries is fundamental to 
          creating an environment where everyone feels respected. Whenever 
          someone requests to respect their personal boundaries, it is 
          important to do so. Please refrain from questioning other 
          people's perceptions when it comes to their personal boundaries. 
          Just because you perceive something differently, as less bad or 
          not bad at all, it doesn't have to correspond to the perception 
          and feelings of the other person.
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">Inclusive language</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          We want to encourage the use of inclusive language that doesn’t 
          make assumptions about others. The use of pronouns according to a 
          person’s wish creates an environment where they feel welcomed. 
          If you are unsure which pronouns a person uses, do not simply 
          assume a gender based on appearance, but ask about the pronouns 
          or do not use any pronouns until you have learned them (e.g. only 
          use the name of the person). Also, please do not use derogatory or 
          discriminatory terms in any form. 
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">Accessibility</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          We prioritize accessibility at events (e.g. ramps, quiet spaces). 
          We try to make each event as accessible for everyone to the best of 
          our ability and the individual needs of our participants. 
          Unfortunately at the time we can’t fully guarantee sufficient accessibility 
          at every single one of our events, but we are committed to learning over 
          time and are constantly reviewing and improving our events in this respect. 
          Please don't hesitate to contact us in advance for needs at help@wavmap.eu. 
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">Reporting procedures</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          Whether it is during online or in-person events, please reach out 
          to our team or any designated staff if you feel uncomfortable with 
          a situation. In online-events please feel free to reach out to our 
          team and/or moderator of the event via direct message. In the event 
          of an incident, the person negatively affected by discrimination and/or 
          the violation of their personal boundaries always decides what support 
          is required. Together with our team, options for dealing with the 
          incident are discussed and actions will be taken accordingly. 
          Where possible, we provide a safe and quiet room to provide a place 
          of retreat for affected persons. Posters will be displayed at the 
          event explaining how to contact the relevant staff and will include 
          contact details. Additionally you can report problematic situations 
          after the event by writing to us at help@wavmap.eu. Reporting is 
          confidential. We commit to responding within 48 hours and involving 
          affected parties in decisions where possible. Our team will also be 
          available after an incident to provide emotional support to affected 
          people and will refer them to further support services, where needed. 
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">Consequences</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          In case of abuse, harassment, violence or discrimination against 
          another person or group that occurs during an online or in-person 
          event, depending on the gravity of the situation and in accordance 
          with victim’s demands, we will take consequences ranging from 
          warnings to temporary or definite exclusion from an event, as well 
          as from the WAVMAP platform. Incidents might be documented 
          (anonymously) and used for prevention at future events. 
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <p class="large">Prioritization of safety of marginalised groups</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          Although we aim towards a club culture where everyone feels 
          equally welcome, we acknowledge that this is not yet the case. 
          We therefore want to collectively prioritize the safety of marginalised groups. 
        </p>

        <div class="separator" />

          personal boundaries and resolutely counter such behavior. There 
          are people responsible for awareness during our event - but it 
          is also necessary that we all take responsibility individually. 
          As we believe in collective action and responsibility, we strongly 
          encourage bystander intervention. If it is safe to do so, we 
          encourage participants to intervene in a situation that appears 
          to be one of harassment or discrimination. If you are unable to 
          intervene for whatever reason, we encourage you to reach out to 
          our team in these instances, also if you aren’t affected yourself 
          or if you are unsure, if a person is indeed in need of help or not. 
          We call on everyone to be mindful and attentive when working 
          together and ask everyone to pay attention to and respect their 
          own and others' needs and boundaries. If support is required in 
          communicating boundaries, our designated staff is also available for this.

        <p class="text-base">
          WAVMAP is a digital platform for the independent electronic music scene. 
          WAVMAP encourages DJs, producers, promoters, labels and curators from all 
          over Europe to find like-minded individuals and collectives to exchange, 
          co-create and collaborate. We see WAVMAP as a contribution to a better 
          connected, more resilient underground scene, where artists and music 
          transcend borders to nurture creativity, generate new opportunities and build solidarity. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          WAVMAP empowers artists, activists and professionals to expand 
          their networks, provides them with valuable insights into less-explored 
          cities for live performances, and fosters cross-border co-creation beyond 
          the major electronic music hubs. By doing so, WAVMAP not only helps 
          bridge geographical gaps but also aims to support more inclusive, 
          sustainable, and collaborative music practices across Europe.

        <p class="xtra-large">FAQ</p>
        <p class="large">Why does WAVMAP mention club politics in the inscription form ?</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          Electronic music and rave culture have always been tied to resistance—born 
          from the creativity and need for liberation of marginalized communities 
          (BiPOC, queer, and working-class artists) who pioneered genres like techno, 
          house, footwork, and jungle. Yet today, many of these same groups face 
          exclusion as cultural appropriation, corporate interests and, in some cases, 
          fascist or reactionary ideologies infiltrate the scene.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          For marginalized artists, knowing the political values of collaborators 
          and venues isn’t just practical—it’s a matter of safety and survival. 
          WAVMAP highlights these stances to help foster safer spaces and solidarity, 
          ensuring the scene remains a place where its creators can thrive.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          This isn’t about sacrificing joy for politics; it’s about recognizing 
          that activism and celebration go hand in hand. The dance floor has always 
          been political—we’re just honoring that legacy.
        </p>
        <p class="large">
          What’s the economic model of WAVMAP ? 
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          WAVMAP is a project run by Commune de nuit, a non-profit based in Marseille 
          (France). The initial platform development has been made possible thanks to a 
          co-founding by the European Union via the LiveMX program. LiveMX aims at 
          supporting music export and artists mobility within Europe. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          Unlike platforms backed by investment funds or corporations, 
          WAVMAP is and always will be independent and non-profit driven. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          For now, everything on WAVMAP is free to use. In order to guarantee our 
          independence and ensure long-term sustainability, we may introduce optional 
          paid features in the future - fair and accessible to everyone. If you have 
          ideas on fair pricing models or funding strategies, please reach out to us ! 
        </p>

        <p class="large">Why is my country not on the list ?</p>
        <p class="text-base">
          WAVMAP was made possible through co-funding of the European Union’s 
          Creative Europe program, so the initial list only includes countries 
          participating in this program. This also allows us to adopt a more effective 
          and high-quality communication and distribution strategy, since we can focus 
          on a precise number of countries and their respective local scenes. However, 
          in the future, we would like to add more countries to the list. If you would 
          like to support this effort or have ideas for funding opportunities in your 
          country or region, we’d love to hear your ideas !
